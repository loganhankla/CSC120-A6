- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

    I like inheritance because it makes my programming more condensed and parsimonious. It decreases the repetitive work I need to do. I like how it draws relationships between classes. This biggest thing is that it makes programming easier and simpler.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

    Looking up documentation (such as for the Hashtable) was helpful for me. Also, just going in and trying everything before asking for help was good because I understood things more than I feel like I have by myself for past assignments - so I spent less time with a TA or professor helping me. That being said, going to TA hours and office hours is helpful. Even if I don't come with a specific question, it's a productive workspace for me, and I think future students would also benefit from making use of this time. I started the assignment on Sunday and surprised myself with how much I got done (largely by myself) in less than two hours at TA hours.
